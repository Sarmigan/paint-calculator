This is a simple Python script for calculating the amount and cost of paint needed for painting walls. The script allows the user to input wall dimensions, the number of doors and windows, and the desired number of paint coats. It then calculates the total area to be painted, the required amount of paint, and the cost based on different paint brands and sizes
